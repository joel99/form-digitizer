Form Digitizer
Users can fill out forms online - social innovation, go paperless!
Users will upload photo of form and be able to fill it online, and get back a csv of their info.

Assumptions:
    - No persisted information
    - Reasonable photo environment (cv will work)
    - Form flow is left to right, up to down
Flow: 
    - User uploads a photo or pdf of a form on the home page
        - Extension: Allow photo-taking (pretty quick)
        - Extension: Prettify/align form
    - Server processes photo and stores form info into db
        -> id
        -> form sanitized photo (blob)
        -> field information (key, field type, field constraints, question string (image?), location of annotation on pdf)
            -> assume no constraints? maybe max length?
    - Server returns redirect to /form_id
        -> Extension: multipage forms
    - /form_id page
        -> if form info in state, great, otherwise go get it
        -> load react form based on form information
        -> user hits (Complete Form!)
            -> print and download csv
                -> #1 extension: request server to generate pdf, (loading state)
                -> server returns pdf
            -> clear information, do not redirect (imagine a google form or something)
        -> want to upload a new photo? Return home
        -> Extension: overlay the form ontop of pdf
        -> Extension: preview pdf before downloading (pdf.js)
Work Items:
    -> create-react-app
        - design state at each point
        - design app architecture
    -> set up database - refer to Enchanted (MERN stack)
        - design database
    -> setup homepage, photo form
    -> set up server processing of photo (opencv)
        -> directly interfaces with db
    -> set up get request for form information (json to react form) into state
    -> setup frontend for form filling
    -> setup csv download

    -> setup pdf download
    -> Test hummus, provide input coordinates, see where it annotates
